# portfolio
Built my own portfolio from scratch without using a template. This was a great project to practice 
- responsive web design 
- GSAP and basic CSS animation
- design skills 
- HTML, CSS and JS 

I learnt a lot about animation from this project and plan to continuously improve my portfolio going forward.
